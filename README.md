# Hello-World
Hello, 
My name is Olivia. I am from LA and I am sophomore at Berkeley. I started coding this year because my male friends said I wouldn't be good at it (cough David cough). I also like to bake. MY favorite type of cake is vanilla with chocolate frosting but NOT the other way around becuase that pairing is weird.
